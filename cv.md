### About me
I work as a Software Engineer with experience in developing desktop applications and embedded systems. My technical proficiency includes PyQt, Django, and microcontroller firmware development.

I have experience in creating efficient and user-friendly desktop applications using PyQt. My projects include complex GUIs for data visualization, real-time monitoring systems, and comprehensive tools for various industrial applications.

My expertise extends to web development, where I have utilized Django to build scalable and secure web applications. One of my key projects was a web application for warehouse automation, which streamlined inventory management.

In addition to software development, I have an understanding of embedded systems, specifically with STM32 and ESP32 microcontrollers.
